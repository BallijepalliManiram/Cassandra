# Cassandra
	It is an open source.
	It is a distributed database for managing very large amounts of structured data spread out across the world. 
	It provides highly available service with no single point of failure.
	It is a NoSQL database.
	It is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent.
	It is a column-oriented database.
	Its distribution design is based on Amazon’s Dynamo and its data model on Google’s Bigtable.
	Created at Facebook, it differs sharply from relational database management systems.
	Cassandra implements a Dynamo-style replication model with no single point of failure, but adds a more powerful “column family” data model.
	Cassandra is being used by some of the biggest companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, Rackspace, ebay, Twitter, Netflix, and more.
NoSQL database:           
 	It is a type of database which provides a mechanism to store and retrieve the data other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
	These databases were 
		1)	schema-free  
		2)	support easy replication  
		3)	have simple API  
		4)	eventually consistent 
		5)	handle huge amounts of data
	In this we use different data structures compare to RDBMS.
	In this some operations were fastly excused.
	The suitability will depend on the problem it must solve.
